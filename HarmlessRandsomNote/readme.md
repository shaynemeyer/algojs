# Harmless Ransom Note
Determine whether we have enough words in our magazine to create our note.

## Example 1
### Note:
'this is a secret note for you from a secret admirer'

### Magazine:
'puerto rico is a great place you must hike far from town to find a secret waterfall that i am an admirer of but not that it is not as hard as it seems this is my advice for you'

#### Result is False
We use the word secret twice in the note but it is only found once in the magazine.
